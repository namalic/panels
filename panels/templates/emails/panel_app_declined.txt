{{ app.submitter.first_name }},

You submitted a panel, "{{ app.name }}", for {{ c.EVENT_NAME }}.  Unfortunately, we did not have enough time this year to accommodate your panel.  We have so many entries that we are unable to accept the majority of them, and we still encourage you to post about meetups where you can join with people to talk about these topics.  {{ c.EVENT_NAME }} is growing and changing every year, and due to our time and space constraints we often have to decline submissions that we wish we could accept, so please do apply again next year.

If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to send them to {{ c.PANELS_EMAIL }}.
